# CovidTracker API

Hi everyone, this is API project that I made to gather COVID-19 data from Indonesian government.

I used my [HTTP Proxy](https://blue-river-c848.vincenthary19.workers.dev) to avoid CORS issue in my front-end.

Please star this project if you find it useful or interesting!

I modified [Reynadi531's API Project](https://github.com/Reynadi531/api-covid19-indonesia-v2)

APIs are deployed to [Heroku](https://covidtracker-vincenth19-be.herokuapp.com/api) and [Vercel](https://covidtracker-backend.vercel.app/api/) \
Check those links for the endpoints.

Data source is from Indonesian government.

Documentation of their API endpoints from the goverment can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16605343/Tzm6nwoS#d35f1c32-56d8-4af1-8d6e-ef3397653f99). I made this myself since there in no info about it.

> All my API endpoints with `/raw` is raw data from the government.
> <br>The response from my APIs is going to be the same with the respective government's APIs.

# API Endpoints (Work in Progress)

Coming soon.

### Notes

This APIs are very basic, it does not even have error handling. \
I'm still learning because backend isn't my forte.

I hope you find this useful. Stay safe and healthy!
